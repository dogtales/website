To effectively secure user data submission in Supabase, focus on enabling Row Level Security (RLS) to control access based on user roles, and implement specific policies that allow authenticated users to submit data while restricting access to sensitive information for unauthorized users. 

**Key Security Measures for User Data Submission in Supabase**

1. **Enable Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - **Purpose**: RLS restricts access to rows in a table based on the user's identity.
   - **Implementation**: Use SQL commands to enable RLS on relevant tables, ensuring that only authorized users can access their data.

2. **Create Insertion Policies**
   - **Policy for Authenticated Users**: Allow only authenticated users to insert data into the database.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own data"
     ON your_table
     FOR INSERT
     TO authenticated
     WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
     ```

3. **Define Select Policies for Admins**
   - **Admin Access**: Create policies that allow admins to view all data.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all data"
     ON your_table
     FOR SELECT
     TO authenticated
     USING (is_admin = true);
     ```

4. **Authentication Management**
   - **Use Supabase Auth**: Implement user authentication to ensure that only registered users can submit data.
   - **Benefit**: This adds a layer of security by verifying user identities before allowing data submission.

5. **Data Validation and Sanitization**
   - **Client-Side Validation**: Ensure that forms validate user input before submission.
   - **Server-Side Validation**: Implement checks on the server to prevent invalid data from being stored in the database.

6. **API Key Management**
   - **Service Role Key**: Use this key for server-side operations that require elevated permissions.
   - **Client Key**: Use this for client-side operations, ensuring that sensitive operations are not exposed to the client.

7. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Track Data Access**: Implement logging to monitor who accesses or modifies data.
   - **Audit Trails**: Maintain records of data changes for accountability and security audits.

**Conclusion**

By enabling Row Level Security, creating specific policies for data insertion and selection, and implementing robust authentication and validation measures, you can effectively secure user data submissions in Supabase while ensuring that admins have the necessary access to manage the data.
